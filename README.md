# CondorRudderPedal_ESP8622

### What it is used for:
This is an embedded C++ project using PlatformIO. I decided to build my own rudder pedals for the glider flight simulator [condor](https://www.condorsoaring.com/).
The mechanical core is an old fitness stepper with the pedals rearranged more vertically. The easy choice to read the pedal position would have been 2 potentiometers. However, adding them mechanically would not have been an easy task. As I was on the lookout for a fun embedded project anyway, I decided to build my own self-made [sine-cosine-encoder](https://www.motioncontroltips.com/what-is-a-sine-encoder-aka-sine-cosine-encoder/) - mechanically comprised of a 3D-printed toothed rack and 2 self-built IR light barriers.

### Functions:
Each encoder works roughly like this:
- Each encoder has two fix light barriers and a toothed rack moving with the pedal, creating two signals very close to a sine.
- The two light barriers of each encoder are mounted at a distance to create an approx. 90Â° shift between the two signals.
- Each pedal has its encoder (see [DirtySignal_Sin_Cos_Encoder](https://github.com/flyfuri/DirtySignal_Sin_Cos_Encoder)).
- From the pedal positions, a rudder position is calculated and sent via RS232 to an Arduino UNO.
- The Arduino works as a [HID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_interface_device) and just transfers the data to the PC where the simulator (Condor or any other flight simulator) is running. 
The Arduino program is based on [UnoJoy]([https://github.com/kegarlv/ArduinoJoy](https://github.com/AlanChatham/UnoJoy)) and is NOT part of this repository.

### Libraries used: 
The library [DirtySignal_Sin_Cos_Encoder](https://github.com/flyfuri/DirtySignal_Sin_Cos_Encoder) is used to condition and encode the signals. Another library [TimerAndFilter](https://github.com/flyfuri/TimerAndFilter). Both libraries were originally developed for this project.
